# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Medium
# italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic
#
# You can get a list of full family names available on your computer by running
